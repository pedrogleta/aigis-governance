# Functionality: This is a more complex tool. It will receive the data from the nl_to_sql_tool and the original user prompt. It will then feed this into another LLM call with a specific prompt designed to generate Python code (using a library like Matplotlib or Plotly).

# Execution: It will execute the generated Python code (safely, using exec()) to save the plot as an image file (e.g., plot.png).

# Output: The path to the generated image file, which can then be displayed in the UI.
