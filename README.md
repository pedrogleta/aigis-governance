# Aigis Governance

An AI Agent system that allows users to connect to BigQuery datasets and ask natural language questions about data, including creating plots for data visualization.

## Features

- ü§ñ **AI Agents** - Multi-agent system for data analysis and visualization
- üîç **Natural Language Queries** - Ask questions about your data in plain English
- üìä **Data Visualization** - Generate plots and charts automatically
- üóÑÔ∏è **BigQuery Integration** - Direct connection to Google BigQuery datasets
- üíª **Modern Web Interface** - React-based chat interface with dark/green theme

## Architecture

The system consists of:
- **Backend**: Python-based AI agents using Google's ADK framework
- **Frontend**: React + Vite chat interface for user interaction
- **Database**: BigQuery integration for data access and analysis

## Setup and Run

### Prerequisites

Before running the project, make sure you are authenticated with Google Cloud and have access to Vertex AI:

1. **Install PM2 globally**  
   This project uses PM2 for process management. Install it globally:
   ```bash
   npm install -g pm2
   ```

2. **Authenticate with Google Cloud CLI**  
   Make sure you have the [gcloud CLI](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) installed.  
   Run the following command and follow the prompts to log in:
   ```
   gcloud auth login
   ```

3. **Set your default project**  
   Replace `<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>` with your Google Cloud project ID:
   ```
   gcloud config set project <YOUR_PROJECT_ID>
   ```

4. **Use a service account for credentials (recommended)**  
    Instead of using Application Default Credentials, create a Google Cloud service account with the following roles:

    - Vertex AI Service Agent (roles/aiplatform.serviceAgent)
    - BigQuery Data Viewer (roles/bigquery.dataViewer)

    Example commands (replace <YOUR_PROJECT_ID> and `aigis-agent` as needed):

    ```bash
    # Create the service account
    gcloud iam service-accounts create aigis-agent --display-name="Aigis Service Account"

    # Grant roles to the service account
    gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding <YOUR_PROJECT_ID> \
       --member="serviceAccount:aigis-agent@<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
       --role="roles/aiplatform.serviceAgent"

    gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding <YOUR_PROJECT_ID> \
       --member="serviceAccount:aigis-agent@<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
       --role="roles/bigquery.dataViewer"

    # Create a JSON key and save it directly into the backend directory
    gcloud iam service-accounts keys create backend/credentials.json \
       --iam-account=aigis-agent@<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>.iam.gserviceaccount.com
    ```

    The command above will create a JSON key and save it as `backend/credentials.json`. Place the service-account JSON key in the `backend/` directory named `credentials.json` (this will replace the example file `backend/credentials.example.json` if present).

    Important: the JSON key contains sensitive credentials. Do not commit `backend/credentials.json` to source control (add it to `.gitignore` if needed).

    If you prefer to use Application Default Credentials for quick testing, you can still run:
    ```bash
    gcloud auth application-default login
    ```

### Running the Application

This project uses PM2 for process management. Follow these steps to start the system:

1. **Install dependencies** (if not already done):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run the setup script** to start the core services:
   ```bash
   npm run setup
   ```
   This will start the setup and services processes using PM2.

3. **Start the development environment**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   This will start the main application using PM2.

4. **Open your browser** and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`

### PM2 Management Commands

The project includes several PM2 management commands:

```bash
npm run list      # List all running PM2 processes
npm run logs      # View logs from all processes
npm run stop      # Stop the main application
npm run cleanup   # Stop and remove all PM2 processes
```



## Frontend Development

The React frontend is located in the `frontend/` directory and provides:

- üé® **Dark & Green Theme** - Modern, professional interface
- üí¨ **Real-time Chat** - Interactive chat with AI agents
- üìä **Data Visualization** - Display generated plots and charts
- üíª **Code Display** - Syntax-highlighted analysis scripts
- üîÑ **Session Management** - Persistent chat sessions

### Frontend Commands

```bash
cd frontend
npm install          # Install dependencies
npm run dev         # Start development server
npm run build       # Build for production
npm run preview     # Preview production build
```

## Backend Development

The Python backend includes:

- **AI Agents**: Multi-agent system for data analysis
- **BigQuery Tools**: Database connection and query tools
- **Data Science Tools**: Analysis and visualization capabilities

### Backend Commands

```bash
# Start the ADK API server
cd backend
./start_server.sh
```

## API Endpoints

The system provides the following ADK API endpoints:

- `POST /run` - Send chat messages and run AI agents
- `GET /list-apps` - List available applications
- `POST /apps/{app_name}/users/{user_id}/sessions` - Create sessions
- `GET /apps/{app_name}/users/{user_id}/sessions/{session_id}` - Get session

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

- `ROOT_AGENT_MODEL` - AI model to use (default: gemini-2.5-pro)
- `CODE_INTERPRETER_EXTENSION_NAME` - Extension for code execution

### Frontend Configuration

Edit `frontend/config.ts` to customize:
- API base URL
- Feature flags
- UI settings

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **BigQuery Connection Errors**
   - Ensure you're authenticated with `gcloud auth application-default login`
   - Check your project permissions

2. **Frontend Build Errors**
   - Make sure all dependencies are installed: `npm install`
   - Check Tailwind CSS configuration

3. **API Connection Issues**
   - Verify backend is running on correct port
   - Check CORS configuration

### Getting Help

- Check the console for error messages
- Verify your backend is running and accessible
- Ensure all environment variables are set correctly

## Hint

After running the project for the first time, it is recommended to run `uv run list_extensions.py` once and copy the extension value into the .env `CODE_INTERPRETER_EXTENSION_NAME` variable for increased performance of future executions. This will be streamlined in future versions.
