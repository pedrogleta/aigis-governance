# Aigis Governance

An AI Agent system that allows users to connect to datasets and ask natural language questions about data, including creating plots for data visualization.

## Features

- ü§ñ **AI Agents** - Multi-agent system for data analysis and visualization
- üîç **Natural Language Queries** - Ask questions about your data in plain English
- üìä **Data Visualization** - Generate plots and charts automatically
- üóÑÔ∏è **BigQuery Integration** - Direct connection to Google BigQuery datasets
- üíª **Modern Web Interface** - React-based chat interface with dark/green theme

## Architecture

The system consists of:
- **Backend**: Python-based FastAPI backend
- **Frontend**: React + Vite chat interface for user interaction
- **Database**: BigQuery integration for data access and analysis

## Setup and Run

### Prerequisites

### Running the application (locally)

The backend is a FastAPI app and the frontend uses Vite. During development run them separately from the project root:

Backend (from `backend/`):
```bash
# create and activate a uv-managed virtual environment and sync dependencies
cd backend
uv venv
uv sync
# run the server inside the uv venv
uv run uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

Frontend (from `frontend/`):
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Running with Docker Compose

A docker-compose setup is provided to run the full stack (Postgres, MinIO, backend, frontend). From the project root:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

This will expose:
- Backend: http://localhost:8000
- Frontend (Vite dev server): http://localhost:3000



## Backend Development

The project uses a custom FastAPI backend. The backend provides authentication, chat endpoints (SSE streaming), and connections to both PostgreSQL (primary) and user-created SQLite databases.

Key backend locations:

- `backend/app/main.py` - FastAPI application entrypoint
- `backend/app/routes/auth.py` - Authentication endpoints (register, login, user management)
- `backend/app/routes/chat.py` - Chat/thread endpoints and SSE streaming
- `backend/core/database.py` - Database manager and FastAPI DB dependencies (Postgres + SQLite)

### Backend Commands (development)

Use one of the following from the `backend/` directory to run the server for development:

```bash
# Run with uvicorn (module path)
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

# Or run via python (calls uvicorn inside main)
python -m backend.app.main
```

Note: The backend runs with Uvicorn and the frontend uses Vite during development. Docker Compose will run both services so you can open the frontend at the address above.
```

## Backend Development

The Python backend includes:

- **AI Agents**: Multi-agent system for data analysis
- **BigQuery Tools**: Database connection and query tools
- **Data Science Tools**: Analysis and visualization capabilities

### Backend Commands

Use Uvicorn for local development:

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

## API Endpoints

The backend exposes REST and SSE endpoints for chat and agent orchestration. Refer to `backend/app/routes` for details.

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

- `ROOT_AGENT_MODEL` - AI model to use (default: gemini-2.5-pro)
- `CODE_INTERPRETER_EXTENSION_NAME` - Extension for code execution

### Frontend Configuration

Edit `frontend/config.ts` to customize:
- API base URL
- Feature flags
- UI settings

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **BigQuery Connection Errors**
   - Ensure your Google Cloud credentials (service account or ADC) are available to the backend when using BigQuery
   - Check your project permissions

2. **Frontend Build Errors**
   - Make sure all dependencies are installed: `npm install`
   - Check Tailwind CSS configuration

3. **API Connection Issues**
   - Verify backend is running on correct port
   - Check CORS configuration

### Getting Help

- Check the console for error messages
- Verify your backend is running and accessible
- Ensure all environment variables are set correctly

## Hint

If your setup uses BigQuery or other cloud services, place any service account JSON credentials in `backend/credentials.json` (do not commit this file). Use environment variables or a `.env` file for secrets and configuration.
