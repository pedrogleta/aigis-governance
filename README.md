# Aigis Governance

An AI Agent system that allows users to connect to BigQuery datasets and ask natural language questions about data, including creating plots for data visualization.

## Features

- ü§ñ **AI Agents** - Multi-agent system for data analysis and visualization
- üîç **Natural Language Queries** - Ask questions about your data in plain English
- üìä **Data Visualization** - Generate plots and charts automatically
- üóÑÔ∏è **BigQuery Integration** - Direct connection to Google BigQuery datasets
- üíª **Modern Web Interface** - React-based chat interface with dark/green theme

## Architecture

The system consists of:
- **Backend**: Python-based AI agents using Google's ADK framework
- **Frontend**: React + Vite chat interface for user interaction
- **Database**: BigQuery integration for data access and analysis

## Setup and Run

### Prerequisites

Before running the project, make sure you are authenticated with Google Cloud and have access to Vertex AI:

1. **Authenticate with Google Cloud CLI**  
   Make sure you have the [gcloud CLI](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) installed.  
   Run the following command and follow the prompts to log in:
   ```
   gcloud auth login
   ```

2. **Set your default project**  
   Replace `<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>` with your Google Cloud project ID:
   ```
   gcloud config set project <YOUR_PROJECT_ID>
   ```

3. **Set up Application Default Credentials**  
   This is required for Vertex AI access:
   ```
   gcloud auth application-default login
   ```

### Option 1: Full AI Agent System (Production)

1. **Create and activate a virtual environment, install dependencies, and run the app**  
   ```
   uv venv
   uv sync
   source .venv/bin/activate
   adk web
   ```

2. **Start the React frontend** (in a new terminal):
   ```
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Open your browser** and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`

### Option 2: Development/Testing Mode

1. **Start the mock backend** (for testing without full AI setup):
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python backend_example.py
   ```

2. **Start the React frontend** (in a new terminal):
   ```
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Open your browser** and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`

## Frontend Development

The React frontend is located in the `frontend/` directory and provides:

- üé® **Dark & Green Theme** - Modern, professional interface
- üí¨ **Real-time Chat** - Interactive chat with AI agents
- üìä **Data Visualization** - Display generated plots and charts
- üíª **Code Display** - Syntax-highlighted analysis scripts
- üîÑ **Session Management** - Persistent chat sessions

### Frontend Commands

```bash
cd frontend
npm install          # Install dependencies
npm run dev         # Start development server
npm run build       # Build for production
npm run preview     # Preview production build
```

## Backend Development

The Python backend includes:

- **AI Agents**: Multi-agent system for data analysis
- **BigQuery Tools**: Database connection and query tools
- **Data Science Tools**: Analysis and visualization capabilities

### Backend Commands

```bash
# For production AI system
uv venv
uv sync
source .venv/bin/activate
adk web

# For development/testing
pip install -r requirements.txt
python backend_example.py
```

## API Endpoints

The system provides the following API endpoints:

- `GET /health` - Health check
- `GET /api/health/bigquery` - BigQuery connection status
- `POST /api/chat` - Send chat messages and receive AI responses

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

- `ROOT_AGENT_MODEL` - AI model to use (default: gemini-2.5-pro)
- `CODE_INTERPRETER_EXTENSION_NAME` - Extension for code execution

### Frontend Configuration

Edit `frontend/config.ts` to customize:
- API base URL
- Feature flags
- UI settings

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **BigQuery Connection Errors**
   - Ensure you're authenticated with `gcloud auth application-default login`
   - Check your project permissions

2. **Frontend Build Errors**
   - Make sure all dependencies are installed: `npm install`
   - Check Tailwind CSS configuration

3. **API Connection Issues**
   - Verify backend is running on correct port
   - Check CORS configuration

### Getting Help

- Check the console for error messages
- Verify your backend is running and accessible
- Ensure all environment variables are set correctly

## Hint

After running the project for the first time, it is recommended to run `uv run list_extensions.py` once and copy the extension value into the .env `CODE_INTERPRETER_EXTENSION_NAME` variable for increased performance of future executions. This will be streamlined in future versions.
